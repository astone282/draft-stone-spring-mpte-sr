1.  Introduction

   The document [I-D.draft-kompella-teas-mpte] introduces a multipath
   traffic engineering concept that combines the benefits of both Equal-
   Cost Multipath (ECMP) forwarding and traffic-engineered paths.  This
   approach uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based forwarding
   mechanism, with the DAG signaled to participating network nodes.  The
   concept is to move beyond simple ECMP paths by incorporating both
   ECMP and non-ECMP paths while still adhering to traffic engineering
   constraints, to provide added resiliency while also permitting better
   usage of link bandwidth.

   [I-D.draft-kompella-teas-mpte] outlines the architecture design which
   can be applied to both distributed and centralized signaling for
   various tunnel types, including MPLS, IP, and others while leaving
   the specific details of each out of scope.

   This document proposes and discusses a centralized computation and
   signaling mechanism for SR-based networks, primarily utilizing
   existing constructs and capabilities.  As MPTE evolves, new
   extensions to SR-based documents may be needed, both in terms of
   architecture and protocol-specific semantics.

   The document assumes the reader is familiar with [RFC8402],
   [RFC9256], and [I-D.draft-kompella-teas-mpte].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

   *  For MPTE terminology such as MPTED, DAG, MC, MID, Junction node
      and others see [I-D.draft-kompella-teas-mpte].

   *  For SR terminology see [RFC8402] and [RFC9256].

3.  MP-TE vs Multiple SID lists

   It's important to recognize the SR Policy information model supports
   multiple SID lists, effectively encoding multiple unique paths on a
   tunnel at the ingress.  A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) can be
   represented as a collection of individual paths, each of which can be
   programmed as a separate SID list within an SR Policy Candidate Path.
   However, depending on the graph topology, the number of unique paths
   to encode can grow significantly.  Additionally, in traditional SID
   list approaches, hashing is performed only at the ingress, rather
   than at each downstream node.  In contrast, a DAG-based mechanism may
   allow better traffic distribution or localized tuning based on
   localized weight changes.  Finally, the maximum segment depth (MSD)
   may need to be considered for long paths that deviate significantly
   from the shortest path.

   In comparison, encoding a DAG’s forwarding instructions across the
   participating Junction nodes reduces the number of individual SID
   lists at the ingress, but at the cost of increasing state in the
   network.  While source-based routing aims to reduce network state,
   there is a trade-off between the volume and length of SID lists
   versus distributing that state throughout the network to achieve
   multipath traffic engineering use cases.

   The choice between using multiple ingress segment lists or the MPTE
   DAG-based distribution mechanism depends on the traffic engineering
   requirements, overall network design, link/path metrics, and the
   DAG’s structure.

4.  MP-TE concepts with Segment Routing

   This document proposes the below concepts for applying MPTE in an SR
   environment.

4.1.  MPTED

   The MPTED is managed by a centralized controller, such as a PCE
   acting as the MC.  Topology discovery is performed using BGP-LS
   [RFC7752], while transport control plane signaling is achieved
   through controller-oriented protocols such as PCEP [RFC5440],
   [RFC8231] and BGP/BGP-LS
   [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy],
   [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ls-sr-policy].  The MC computes, manages, and
   distributes all forwarding information to the nodes participating in
   the MPTE DAG, which form the MPTED.

   [I-D.draft-kompella-teas-mpte] specifies that a node in the MPTED is
   identified by its IPv6 loopback address.  However, this document
   allows the use of a 32-bit dotted quad router ID as an alternative.
   This value represents the headend address of a node participating in
   the DAG.

   As per [I-D.draft-kompella-teas-mpte], the controller acting as the
   MC is responsible for assigning the MPID and incrementing the MPTED
   unique ID version.

4.2.  Junction Segment

   The concept of a Junction Segment is introduced to describe the
   signaling and forwarding behavior of a Junction node in an SR
   network.

   It’s worth noting that the architectural concept of a Junction
   Segment is similar to a Replication Segment [RFC9524], but it
   performs forwarding based on load balancing rather than replication.

   A Junction Segment is installed on nodes identified as Junction
   Nodes, as defined in [I-D.draft-kompella-teas-mpte].

   This document version proposes that a Junction Segment is realized
   using the existing SR Policy construct with a single Candidate Path
   and a Binding SID.

   A Binding Segment is attached to an SR Policy Candidate Path with one
   or more SID Lists, each representing an outgoing link or a segmentr
   routed path to a downstream node with the top SID identifying the
   outgoing interface of the link.

   Since a Junction Segment may egress to multiple downstream nodes, the
   endpoint of the corresponding SR Policy MUST be set to the null value
   (0.0.0.0).  Therefore, a Junction segment is identified by its
   <headend, color> attribute.

   This document assumes that the color value is mapped to the <MID,
   Version> tuple and is tracked by the controller.

   It is RECOMMENDED that a globally consistent color value be used
   across all Junction Segments that belong to a single DAG instance or
   that serve a common DAG intent.

   A DAG may consist of multiple Junction Segments that collectively
   represent a single DAG tunnel.  This MP-TE tunnel is used by one or
   many SR Policies instantiated on one or many ingress nodes.  A
   Junction Segment may be reused by multiple ingress SR Policies,
   provided that the subgraph it forwards over is fully shared by all SR
   Policies using it, including the set of their respective egress
   nodes.

   The ingress SR Policy is responsible for initiating traffic steering
   into the DAG and is associated with a color value representing
   service intent.  The junction segment, on the other hand, is a DAG
   forwarding construct implemented as an SR Policy with a BSID.

   To support global optimization with make-before-break (MBB)
   operations across a set of ingress SR Policies, the color value used
   by Junction Segments SHOULD differ from the color values of the
   ingress SR Policies that are consumers of the DAG.  This distinction
   allows ingress SR Policies to independently manage service steering
   while enabling consistent forwarding behavior across the DAG.

   The controller is responsible for maintaining and tracking the
   association and semantic meaning of color values across all Junction
   Segments that participate in the DAG.  See Section 9.5 for additional
   discussion.

   Accordingly, an implementation SHOULD treat ingress SR Policies and
   Junction Segments as decoupled constructs, each with their own
   versioning and lifecycle.

   Since SR-based networks support specifying multiple egress interfaces
   using adjacency-SID sets and Node SIDs, the Junction Segment MAY
   include a SID list entry that identifies multiple outgoing
   interfaces.  In addition to egress interfaces,
   [I-D.draft-kompella-teas-mpte] describes signaling ingress
   interfaces.  The use of a Junction Segment omits the need for per-
   interface ingress signaling as a single Binding Segment attached to
   an SR Policy is used.  All upstream originated traffic sent to a
   downstream Junction Node uses the same, single Junction Segment value
   which is a Binding Segment.

4.3.  MPTE SR Policy - Tunnel with multiple ingress/egress

   [I-D.draft-kompella-teas-mpte] specifies that an MPTE Tunnel could
   have multiple ingress and/or multiple egress nodes.  Currently, the
   SR Policy architecture defines an SR Policy using a {Headend,
   Endpoint, Color} tuple, where the Endpoint may be set to the null
   value (0.0.0.0), indicating multiple destinations.

   For controller-initiated tunnels, the intended ingress and egress
   node(s) can be provided to the controller based on implementation-
   specific methods.  These may be signaled to the network as multiple
   tunnels to support multi-ingress scenarios.  Each tunnel MAY use a
   null Endpoint value to support multi-egress.

   However, MPTE SR Policies that are originated or defined by network
   devices are typically limited to a single ingress and a single egress
   endpoint unless protocols such as PCEP or NETCONF are extended to
   encode additional intended destination node(s) for controller-based
   path computation.

   As mentioned in section 4.2, the DAG tunnel may be re-used by
   multiple ingress SR Policies.  This mechanism is used to support
   acheiving multiple ingress nodes originated from the network, by way
   of the controller binding and attaching the ingress SR Policies to a
   pre-existing DAG sharing the same intent and endpoints.

5.  Operation

   A path computation request or tunnel delegation notification is sent
   to the controller, specifying one or more ingress and egress nodes,
   along with constraints.  This request may originate from an ingress
   router in the network or be provisioned directly via an API to the
   controller.  This tunnel computation request or delegation pertains
   to an instance of an MPTE Tunnel achieved with the ingress SR Policy.

   The controller computes the DAG for ingress and all egress endpoints
   to determine all Junction nodes in the DAG to be used for the tunnel.

   The controller signals the Junction Segment(s) to all downstream
   nodes, starting with the penultimate egress hop node(s) and working
   upwards toward the ingress nodes.

   Junction Segment deployments are in the form of a unicast SR Policy
   with a single Candidate Path using protocols such as PCEP, BGP, or
   NETCONF.  The optional use of an MPTED Reflector is protocol
   specific.  For example, PCEP sessions terminate on each and every
   Junction node in the topology and BGP may do the same or make use of
   a BGP Route Reflector.  A BSID MUST be explicitly requested or
   signaled to the Junction node for assignment.  If the controller opts
   for local node assigned value, it MUST wait to signal upstream
   Junction nodes about their Junction segments in their outgoing SID
   lists.  The BSID value MAY be a constant value globally, if assigned
   by PCE/Controller, or may be a different value on each Junction Node
   whether it’s assigned by PCE/Controller or the local Junction Node
   itself.

   Each SR Policy contains one or more SID lists.  These SID lists must
   include at least two segment identifiers: one SID for forwarding to
   the downstream Junction node and one for the Junction Segment value
   (BSID) of the downstream node.  For directly connected neighbors,
   this may be the adjacency or node SID for the neighbor.  For Junction
   nodes that are not directly connected, additional SIDs MAY be used to
   steer the packet along an ECMP or non-ECMP path to the downstream
   Junction node.  It is worth noting that if the SID list comprises of
   only an Adjacency-SID and the Junction SID of the neighbor node, then
   the dataplane packet contains only one SID on egress which is the
   Junction SID of the neighboring node.

             Figure 1 : Example Topology to apply DAG

   Figure 1 presents a sample topology for one ingress and one egress
   MPTE Tunnel established as an SR Policy.  The MPTE tunnel is from A
   to H.  The figure presents the bi-directional link weights for an
   arbitrary metric (IGP, TE, Delay etc).

   Note there is a mesh between C, D, F and G of weight 5 per link.
   Pruned represents an excluded link due to TE constraints.  In the
   below, the terminology {u,v} represents a unidirectional link between
   U and V.  The terminology Adj-SID-XY represents an adjacency SID from
   X to Y.  Node-SID-X represents the node SID path to X.

   A MPTE DAG is computed to contain nodes B,C,D,E,F,G with the links
   {G, F} / {F, G} pruned.

   The below Junction Segments are deployed to the network realized with
   an SR Policy with a single Candidate Path containing multiple segment
   lists.  Note the following:

   *  When the DAG is computed, loops cannot exist.  Therefore, in the
      above topology the links in direction {C, B} and {C,D} and {C,F}
      and {C,G} are chosen in the DAG.

   *  The path along {B,E,H} can be represented by a single Node SID.  A
      Junction on node E is not required.  Junction Segment B may also
      be omitted (as per Section 8 below) but is utilized here for
      example purposes.

   *  Junction F is described below, but an optimization could be
      performed to exclude Junction F as it only has one egress link
      (see Section 8 below).

   *  In practice the Binding Segments MAY be all the same value.  This
      example describes different BSID values for readability.

   *  Weights of each egress SID list is also currently omitted.

   *  The color on the ingress SR Policy still provides intent steering
      for ingress traffic, therefore SHOULD be unique to the color value
      of the Junction segments comprising of the DAG to permit
      globalized make-before-break behavior.

Junction Segment B:
  Color: 100
  BSID: BSID-B
  SID List 1: [Node-SID-H]

Junction Segment F:
  Color: 100
  BSID: BSID-F
  SID List 1: [Adj-SID-FH]

Junction Segment G:
  Color: 100
  BSID: BSID-G
  SID List 1: [Adj-SID-GH]

Junction Segment C:
  Color: 100
  BSID: BSID-C
  SID List 1: [Adj-SID-CB, BSID-B]
  SID List 2: [Adj-SID-CF, BSID-F]
  SID List 3: [Adj-SID-CG, BSID-G]
  SID List 4: [Node-SID-D, BSID-D]

Junction Segment D:
  Color: 100
  BSID: BSID-D
  SID List 2: [Adj-SID-DF, BSID-F]
  SID List 3: [Adj-SID-DG, BSID-G]

Then lastly, at ingress the SR Policy transport tunnel is configured with the following:

Ingress SR Policy (Using Junction Segments):
  Color: 50
  Candidate Path 1:
    SID List 1: [Adj-SID-AB, BSID-B]
    SID List 2: [Adj-SID-AC, BSID-C]
    SID List 3: [Adj-SID-AD, BSID-D]

   In comparison, if the above DAG was encoded at ingress then the
   following individual segment lists could be used to represent the
   above DAG.  Note, some of the below could be compressed with a Node
   SID(s) but listed with adjacency for explicit example.

   Ingress SR Policy (Ingress only):
     Color: 50
     Candidate Path 1:
       SID List 1: [Adj-SID-AC, Adj-SID-CF, Adj-SID-FH]
       SID List 2: [Adj-SID-AC, Node-SID-D, Adj-SID-DG, Adj-SID-GH]
       SID List 3: [Adj-SID-AC, Node-SID-D, Adj-SID-DF, Adj-SID-FH]
       SID List 4: [Adj-SID-AC, Adj-SID-CF, Adj-SID-CG, Adj-SID-GH]
       SID List 5: [Adj-SID-AC, Adj-SID-CF, Adj-SID-BE, Adj-SID-EH]
       SID List 6: [Adj-SID-AB, Node-SID-H]
       SID List 7: [Adj-SID-AD, Adj-SID-DG, Adj-SID-GH]
       SID List 8: [Adj-SID-AD, Adj-SID-DF, Adj-SID-FH]

6.  Load-balancing

   When a packet with the BSID assigned to the Junction Segment is
   received at its Junction Node, the node performs weighted ECMP
   (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) flow-based forwarding across all egress SID
   lists associated with the Junction Segment.

   As per [RFC9256] section 2.11, The fraction of the flows associated
   with a given segment list is w/Sw, where w is the weight of the
   segment list and Sw is the sum of the weights of the segment lists.
   To exclude forwarding via a specific egress interface while
   preserving the forwarding structure, a weight value of zero is
   assigned to the corresponding segment list.

7.  Constraints

   When the controller computes the DAG, traffic engineering constraints
   MUST be considered.  Links which violate the constraints are pruned
   from the DAG.  Nodes which do not form the DAG are not notified with
   any Junction segments.

8.  Protection

   As described in [I-D.draft-kompella-teas-mpte], as there are multiple
   egress interfaces (SID Lists), the loss of one interface link does
   not result in traffic drops, as long as one egress interface (SID
   List) remains although congestion may occur.  For example, in
   Figure 1 Node C can tolerate the lost of up to 3 egress links and
   traffic will still forward (potentially with congestion).

   If a Junction Node experiences a failure of all egress links
   (including any protection for those links), it will initially
   blackhole traffic until upstream nodes are notified by the controller
   to remove the failed Junction node from the DAG.

   To reduce the risk of outages caused by single link failure, the
   controller MAY optimize DAG deployment by assigning Junction Segments
   only to nodes with more than one egress segment list.  In other
   words, if a node in the DAG has only one egress interface, it
   functions solely as a transit node for an upstream Junction Segment
   and does not receive a Junction Segment itself.  For example, in
   Figure 1, Node E is omitted from receiving a Junction Segment as it
   only has 1 egress link.

   Link protection from an upstream Junction node to its downstream
   Junction nodes can be achieved using existing TI-LFA
   [I-D.draft-ietf-rtgwg-segment-routing-ti-lfa] mechanisms, applied per
   egress SID List on each Junction Segment.  Since the top SID(s) in
   each SID List identify the path to the next downstream Junction node,
   TI-LFA is applicable.  Effectively, TI-LFA is used to protect traffic
   between Junction Segments along a path within the DAG and is not
   intended to protect traffic directed toward the DAG’s egress nodes or
   the entire DAG.

   Local computation for node protection on an upstream Junction node is
   not feasible, because it lacks visibility into the DAG beyond the
   immediate downstream Junction node as it only knows the next Junction
   Segment.  A controller MAY be used to precompute backup SR Paths and
   signal these backup SID Lists to the upstream Junction segments.

9.  Other considerations

9.1.  Hierarchy

   The use of Junction Segments to achieve a DAG can be used in
   hierarchical organization and sharing of DAGs between end-to-end
   tunnels.

   For instance, in a multi-area or multi-instance topology, one or more
   shared DAGs may be created per area, connecting the border ingress
   node(s) and egress node(s).  These DAGs can then be stitched together
   for use in an end-to-end SR tunnel.

   Figure 2 is an example of two independent SR Policy Tunnels from
   Headend A and Headend B terminating on Egress X.  An instance of a
   DAG with MID 100 can be configured between ABR-1 and the Egress X
   node.  ABR-1 Junction Segment which ingresses the DAG has a Binding
   Segment attached, for example BSID-100.  Therefore, the SID list on
   Headend A and Headend B SID lists would contain the SR Path (ex:
   Node-SID-ABR-1) to reach ABR 1 followed by BSID-100.  The instruction
   set from each Headend to ABR 1 could also be another instance of a
   DAG, either for independent use or shared.

9.2.  Directly connected Junction nodes

   As described in the Operational section, all transit nodes in a DAG
   MAY be signaled with a Junction Segment.  Alternatively depending on
   the topological graph and TE requirements, two Junction segments may
   be interconnected via an SR Path, with a SID list, where the SR Path
   itself may correspond to an ECMP or TE Path.

9.3.  Broadcast links

   SR networks abstract broadcast links with the use point to point
   adjacency segments identifying each neighbor.  Specifying a DAG which
   contains a broadcast link is feasible as an adjacency segment can be
   used to identify the neighboring Junction node on the broadcast link.
   The outgoing SID List of the Junction Segment simply contains the
   adjacency SID of the next-hop neighbor on the broadcast link.

10.  Optimization

10.1.  Local optimization

   Local optimization refers to updates applied to a single Junction
   node that can be performed without requiring coordinated updates
   across multiple nodes in the DAG.  These operations are considered
   safe when they do not introduce forwarding loops or cause
   reachability interruptions within the DAG.

   Examples of local optimizations include:

   *  Manipulating the weight distribution of the outgoing SID lists

   *  Replacing an existing SID list with a more optimal one (e.g. using
      a new adjacency SID or updated SR path to the next Junction node).

   *  Adding a new SID list toward an egress node that is not itself a
      Junction node.

   *  Removing a SID list, provided that at least one other outgoing SID
      list remains active.

   *  Adding a new SID list to a Junction node that connects to a new
      downstream sub-graph which is not yet connected to the DAG
      structure.

   While these operations are scoped to a single node, their correct
   application may still require awareness of the surrounding DAG
   structure to avoid introducing loops or reachability issues.  For
   instance, the addition of a new SID list may require confirmation
   that the new sub-graph is not already part of the DAG, or that it
   connects loop free.

   Local optimizations may also be chained in sequence across multiple
   nodes.  When each step maintains loop free and reachable properties,
   such a chain of updates is still considered local in nature.

   For example:

   *  Cleaning up a upstream disconnected sub-graph following the
      removal of an upstream SID list (BSID is no longer used)

   It is important to note that local optimization differs from global
   optimization in that it does not require versioning or re-signaling
   of the entire DAG structure.

   Since a Junction Segment is realized via an SR Policy, the controller
   leverages existing protocol mechanisms to update a Junction segment
   forwarding instructions, as the Junction Segment itself is
   represented as a candidate path within the SR Policy.  When updating
   an existing candidate path, the binding SID MUST NOT change, as doing
   so would cause traffic using that binding SID to drop until upstream
   consumers are updated.  Such a change should instead be treated as a
   global optimization, not a local one.

   Multiple candidate paths could be used to support more comprehensive
   local optimizations.  However, caution is required in how the MPTED
   version is encoded and how version increments are signaled, since
   candidate paths are signaled within the context of the SR Policy.

   If the same color value is reused and a new candidate path is
   deployed, the new candidate path will not be installed in the
   forwarding plane until the existing one is removed, as only one
   candidate path may be active per SR Policy.  This operation may not
   be hitless, depending on hardware implementation.

   Alternatively, if a different color value is used, the new candidate
   path may be allowed to go active.  However, it will still fail to do
   so since it should be using the same binding SID as the existing
   candidate path.  This results in a collision, rendering the new path
   ineligible, and may also violate protocol constraints that prohibit
   such configurations.

   Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that local optimization be performed by
   updating the SID list of the existing candidate path, rather than
   introducing new candidate paths.

10.1.1.  Local optimization Example

   The following examples use the topology example specified in Figure 1
   and section 5.1.

   Example 1 – Simple SID list update

   *  The Junction Segment B is updated.  The SID list [Node-SID-H] is
      replaced with SID List [Adj-SID-BE, Adj-SID-EH]

   Example 2 – Chained Local Optimization

   *  The ingress SR Policy SID list is updated to remove { SID List 1:
      [Adj-SID-AB, BSID-B] }. Only SID List 2 and SID List 3 remain in
      the SR Policy candidate path

   *  The Junction Segment B is no longer used.

   *  A delete is sent to remove Junction Segment B

10.2.  Global optimization

   Global optimization of a DAG requires coordinated updates across all
   participating Junction Nodes.  This process follows a make-before-
   break model, where a new version of the DAG is deployed alongside the
   existing one.  The ingress SR Policy (or policies) is the last
   element to be updated.

   Since the Color field of an SR Policy indicates DAG membership, and
   is managed by the controller, global optimization with make-before-
   break considerations necessitates deploying new Junction segments.
   This, in turn, requires the instantiation of new SR Policies with
   unique Color values.  These new SR Policies are deployed to all
   Junction Nodes participating in the updated DAG instance and must be
   associated with distinct Binding SID values from those of the
   existing instance.

   To minimize version churn and both color and label consumption, it is
   RECOMMENDED that controllers limit the number of concurrently
   deployed DAG instances for the same tunnel.  Under normal conditions,
   only a single active DAG version should exist.  During transitions,
   at most two versions (the current and the new one) should be present.
   Color and label values may be reused once globally released.

   The Binding SID associated with a DAG instance MUST remain constant
   during local optimizations, but MUST change during global
   optimizations to avoid the risk of routing loops.  Therefore, in the
   example above, if a Junction Node is participating in DAG #1, version
   #1 continues to use one binding SID value and version #2 is using a
   distinct binding SID value on each Junction node.

   Once all Junction segments are deployed to all Junction nodes, the
   ingress node is updated with new SID lists referencing the Binding
   SIDs of the new Junction segments downstream.

   The Color field on ingress nodes is critical for traffic steering and
   therefore MUST remain constant during global optimizations.  In
   contrast, Color values used on Junction Nodes MAY be reused or
   encoded to reflect DAG membership or instance mappings.  Similarly,
   the binding SID on the ingress SR Policy also remains constant.

   The controller tracks the Color values and their corresponding usage
   for DAG ID and version.  For example:

   *  Color value 500 – DAG #1 – Version #1

   *  Color value 501 – DAG #2 – Version #1

   *  Color value 502 – DAG #1 – Version #2

   When performing global updates, controllers SHOULD ensure that all
   Junction Nodes are updated in a coordinated and consistent manner
   before activating the new DAG on the ingress.  If the update process
   fails partially, the controller SHOULD roll back the new deployment
   and retain the existing stable DAG version and it's Junction Segments
   to avoid inconsistencies in forwarding behavior.

             Figure 3 : Global MBB Example Topology

   *Step 0 - Initial State*

   Figure 3 gives an example topology containing a DAG which is to
   undergo optimization.  Node Z is the ingress Node with an SR Policy
   color 1000 representing a service intent.  Node W is the egress node.
   Color 2000 is the DAG MID and version tracked by the controller.  In
   the existing state of the DAG, traffic flows from west to east, and
   north to south on nodes Y and X.  The diagonal link between Y and U
   is currently not used.

   Junction Segment Y1:
     Color: 2000
     BSID: BSID-Y1
     SID List 1: [Adj-SID-YX, BSID-X1]
     SID List 2: [Adj-SID-YV, Adj-SID-VU]

   Junction Segment X1:
     Color: 2000
     BSID: BSID-X1
     SID List 1: [Adj-SID-XW]
     SID List 2: [Adj-SID-XU, Adj-SID-UW]

   Ingress SR Policy:
     Color: 1000
     Candidate Path 1:
     SID List 1: [Adj-SID-ZY, BSID-Y1]
     SID List 2: [Adj-SID-ZV, Adj-SID-VU, Adj-SID-UW]

   *Step 1 - Deploy new Junction Segments*

   An optimization calculation occurs requiring the DAG to change, the
   traffic will now flow from south to north instead of north to south,
   and the diagonal link between Y and U will be used.

   The controller assigns and tracks color 2001 for the new DAG.  The
   following new Junction segments are deployed in the following order.
   The BSID values are either assigned by the controller, or requested
   by the node depending on the protocol in use.  Note that after this
   deployment node Y has two Junction segments installed on it, both of
   which are active.

   CREATE Junction Segment U2:
     Color: 2001
     BSID: BSID-U2
     SID List 1: [Adj-SID-UX, ADJ-SID-XW]
     SID List 2: [Adj-SID-UW]

   CREATE Junction Segment Y2:
     Color: 2001
     BSID: BSID-Y2
     SID List 1: [Adj-SID-YX, ADJ-SID-XW]
     SID List 2: [Adj-SID-YU, BSID-U2]

   CREATE Junction Segment V2:
     Color: 2001
     BSID: BSID-V2
     SID List 1: [Adj-SID-VY, BSID-Y2]
     SID List 2: [Adj-SID-VU, BSID-U2]

   *Step 2 - Update ingress nodes*

   The existing SR Policy candidate path is updated to use the new DAG.
   Note, the color and any associated binding SID values remain.

   UPDATE Ingress SR Policy:
     Color: 1000
     Candidate Path 1:
       SID List 1: [Adj-SID-ZY, BSID-Y2]
       SID List 2: [Adj-SID-ZV, BSID-V2]

   *Step 3 - Delete the no longer used Junction segments*

   DELETE Junction Segment Y1:
     Color: 2000
     BSID: BSID-Y1

   DELETE Junction Segment X1:
     Color: 2000
     BSID: BSID-X1

11.  Security Considerations

   TODO

12.  Manageability Considerations

   This document currently proposes using the existing SR Policy
   construct with a color value representing the DAG MID and version.
   Since SR Policy color value is originally intended for ingress
   traffic steering on matched routers, a deployment MUST allocate a
   color range which will be used for MPTE and MUST NOT be assigned to
   any advertised routes in the network.
